        Dr. Mansoor Waqas <br>
        Principal <br>
        ABC College, <br>
        Wapda Town, Block X, <br>

        <hr>        
        Dear Dr. Mansoor,<br>
        I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my growing concern about the security measures<br> currently in place at our college. As a dedicated student, I deeply value the safe and supportive<br> environment that our institution strives to provide. However, recent incidents on campus have raised<br> significant apprehensions among the student body regarding our overall security.<br><br>

        Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unauthorized individuals gaining access to our<br> campus facilities. Additionally, several students, including myself, have observed areas around the<br> campus where lighting is inadequate, making these spots potentially dangerous during the evening<br> hours. These issues have understandably led to a heightened sense of vulnerability among students.<br><br>
        
        I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel to discuss these concerns and<br> potential solutions further. I am confident that, together, we can create a more secure and reassuring <br>environment for everyone at college.<br><br>
        
        Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Yours sincerely,<br>
        
        Jameel Shah,<br>
